  <ul >
  <li>Ada showed her gift for mathematics at an early age. </li>
   <br>
   <li>Around the age of 17, Ada met Charles Babbage {Known as the father of the computer,}, a mathematician and inventor, Babbage served as a mentor to Ada. Through Babbage, Ada began studying advanced mathematics with University of London professor Augustus de Morgan, which helps her invent concepts which today computers uses these concepts.</li>
   <br>
   <li>Ada described how codes could be created for the device to handle letters and symbols along with numbers. 
       She also theorized a method for the engine to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping that computer programs use today. Ada also offered up other forward-thinking concepts in the article. For her work, Ada is often considered to be the first computer programmer.</li>
   <br>
   <li>Ada Lovelace's contributions to the field of computer science were not discovered until the 1950s. </li>
  </ul>
